## About The Project



Here's a video demonstrating the US State Game Simulator in action:

[![Pong Game Demo](https://github.com/senabibi/Us_State_Game/blob/main/images/view.gif)

This project presents a unique fusion of data manipulation and game development, making learning both informative and entertaining. Leveraging Python's powerful Pandas and Turtle libraries, I crafted an engaging and educational game centered around the United States. The game involves matching the names of U.S. states on a custom map with their corresponding x and y coordinates extracted from a CSV data file. This dynamic integration of data from the real world and interactive gameplay adds a layer of excitement and relevance to the learning process. Players not only improve their Python programming skills but also gain practical experience in data utilization.

As you navigate the game, the challenge lies in correctly associating state names with their positions on the map, all while managing your allotted attempts wisely. The project's ability to seamlessly blend the practical aspects of data retrieval and the enjoyable elements of gaming enhances the overall learning experience. It not only broadens Python proficiency but also fosters an understanding of the practical applications of programming skills. By bridging the worlds of data analysis and game development, this project has evolved into an engaging, fun, and informative endeavor that promises both enjoyment and knowledge.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. Please follow these steps to get your environment ready.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin with the US State Game project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and ready on your system:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Python is the primary requirement for running this project. If you haven't already, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

* [Replit](https://replit.com): This project is designed to work seamlessly with Replit, a cloud-based development platform. You'll need a Replit account and familiarity with using the platform to get the most out of the project.

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/): If you prefer to run the project locally using PyCharm, make sure you have PyCharm installed on your system.

* [Turtle Graphics Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html): Ensure that you have the Turtle graphics library installed, which is typically included with Python. Turtle graphics will be used to create the interactive map in the game.

* [Pandas Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/): The game relies on the Pandas library for data handling and extraction. Make sure you have Pandas installed as it will be used to manage the data file containing state coordinates.

* Data File: The project utilizes a CSV data file that contains state names along with their respective x and y coordinates. Ensure you have access to this data file for a smooth gaming experience.

These prerequisites will enable you to run and enjoy the US State Game project, where you'll have the opportunity to learn and have fun by matching state names with their map positions.


### Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the US State Game project, which combines Python programming, Turtle graphics, and data handling with Pandas:
